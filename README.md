##History

This game "happened" in a rough-n-tumble 2 weeks, after which three final projects were all due. It's a little rough around the edges, but I got to try out spline-based animations and OpenGL in the raw. I used a close friend's game frameworks library to facilitate multiplatform compatibility (in the end, this was tested to work on both Linux and Windows; OS X seemed to lack stable binaries of SDL2).

##Tools and cool tech

+ [Spice](http://github.com/dreamycactus/Spice)!
+ Spline based jumping (instead of physics-based jumping, which, in hindsight, would have been easier)
